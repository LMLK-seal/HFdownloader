## üåê Live Website

Visit **[HFdownloader.com](https://hfdownloader.com)** to start downloading models instantly.

## üìã How to Use

1. **Enter Model ID**: Input the Hugging Face model identifier (e.g., `unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`)
2. **Click Download**: Press the "Start Download" button to begin
3. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the real-time progress and status updates
4. **Receive ZIP File**: Your complete model repository will be delivered as a ZIP archive
- `Note: Models that require accepting license terms on the Hugging Face Hub may fail to download.`

## üí° ChatBot

- I've added a chatbot that loads a downloaded model folder and lets you chat with an AI.
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install customtkinter tkinter pathlib configparser
```
1. **Load Your Model:**: Type your message into the input box at the bottom and press Enter.
2. **Start Chatting (Optional):** Use the "Load File (TXT/PDF)" button to add context from a document to your conversation.
3. **Set GPU Offload (Optional):**
- Before loading a model, look at the "GPU Offload" setting on the right. This lets you run large models by splitting them between your fast GPU and your computer's regular RAM.
- -1 (Auto - Recommended): The app automatically puts as many layers as possible onto your GPU. This is the best option to try first.
- A positive number (e.g., 20): Manually set how many layers to load onto the GPU. Use this to fine-tune memory usage.
- 0: Runs the entire model on the CPU. This is the slowest option, but works if you don't have a powerful GPU.
